# WebScraper_Python
This is a web scraper for certain article types on the journal site Nature. This webs scraper uses `requests`, `bs4` and `os` packages to parse through HTML sources to pull user specific article bodies and titles to repective paths in the user's directory. This was a course on JetBrains Academy.
